# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Knowledge Base

## What is MCP?
Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol for communication between AI models and development environments. It enables seamless integration of AI capabilities into development workflows by providing a structured way to exchange context, commands, and responses.

## Core Concepts

### Context Management
- MCP servers maintain context about the codebase, user interactions, and development environment
- Context includes file contents, git history, user preferences, and workspace state
- Efficient context management ensures relevant information is available to AI models

### Command Protocol
- Standardized format for commands between client and server
- Supports file operations, code analysis, and AI-assisted development
- Extensible command system for custom functionality

### State Synchronization
- Real-time sync between client and server
- Maintains consistency across multiple clients
- Handles concurrent operations safely

## Implementation Best Practices

### Server Setup
```python
from mcp.server import MCPServer
from mcp.context import CodebaseContext

server = MCPServer(
    context_manager=CodebaseContext(),
    model_provider="your_provider"
)

@server.command("analyze_code")
async def analyze_code(context, file_path):
    # Command implementation
    pass
```

### Context Management
```python
class CustomContext(BaseContext):
    def update_file_content(self, path, content):
        self.file_cache[path] = content
        self.notify_listeners(path)
```

### Error Handling
- Implement robust error handling for network issues
- Validate context updates before processing
- Provide meaningful error messages to clients

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Connection Problems
- Check network connectivity
- Verify server configuration
- Ensure correct authentication

### Context Sync Issues
- Clear context cache
- Reinitialize connection
- Verify file system permissions

### Performance Optimization
- Implement context caching
- Use incremental updates
- Optimize large file handling

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Implement secure authentication
- Use token-based access control
- Regular security audits

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Implement access controls
- Regular security updates

## Integration Patterns

### IDE Integration
- Plugin architecture
- Command routing
- UI/UX considerations

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated testing
- Deployment strategies
- Version management

## Advanced Topics

### Custom Commands
- Command registration
- Parameter validation
- Response handling

### Extensions
